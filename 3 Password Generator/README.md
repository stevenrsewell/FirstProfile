Random Password Generator


<img src="/images/passwordgeneratorscreenshot.png">


This application generates a random password for the user, after the user has selected from certain criteria. The user will initially be asked to enter how long their desired password will be, from 8 to 128 characters. The user will then be asked a series of follow-up questions, that include if the user would like to include uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters. These attributes will make a password much more difficult to crack.

After the password is generated on the screen, the user has an option to copy it to the clipboard. 



<!-- This application was definitely a little challenging for me to complete. I was able to get all the prompts from the user, but am still having a hard time getting the password to show on the sreen.>
